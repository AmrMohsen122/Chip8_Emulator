# Chip8_EmulatorAn Emulator for the __CHIP-8__ Language written in __C++__ using __SDL Library__ __CHIP-8 was created by RCA engineer Joe Weisbecker in 1977 for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer. It was intended as a simpler way to make small programs and games for the computer. Instead of using machine language for the VIP’s CDP1802 processor, you could type in hexadecimal instructions (with the VIP’s hex keypad) that resembled machine code, but which were more high-level, and interpreted on the fly by a small program (the CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter).## Build## Running To Run the Emulator you will find the resulting executable in the build directory of your project```bashcd build```###Execution Flags|    Flag        | Function ||:------------|:-----------||       -s        |        The Emulator execution speed you might want to play around with execution speed as some games expect different speeds than others      ||       -f        |       The file name which contains the binary ROM     |```bash./Emulator.exe -f <ROM FILE NAME> -s <EXECUTION SPEED>```
